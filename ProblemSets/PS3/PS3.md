# Problem Set 3: Databases

## Background


## Instructions

1. Find 5 different sources of publically available biomedical or public health data related to the COVID-19 pandemic (not used so far in this course). Briefly describe (in about one or two sentences what each source is) the data and provide a link to the data source. 
2. Pick one of these sources and download a dataset from that source.
3. Load the dataset into R and calculate some simple summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, min, max, variance, if the variable is continuous) for 5 variables.


## The report

Develop a report (I recommend a Word (or other text editor) document) for your problem set that includes answers to all of the questions posed above, showing plots where appropriate. Also include a functional R script or a screen shot of the R commands used to load the dataset into R and calculate the summary statistics.

Save your report as a PDF file and submit your report through the course 2GW site. Clean up your code and submit it as a supplementary file, along with your main report.
